### üß¨ Lesson: Biology Basics

Biology is the science of life. It includes:

- **Cell Theory**: All living things are made of cells.
- **Genetics**: DNA carries genetic information.
- **Evolution**: Populations change over generations.
- **Ecology**: Interactions between organisms and environment.

Real Example: Mitosis is the process by which cells divide to create new cells.

Practice: What organelle is the control center of the cell?

        "geometry": """
### üìê Lesson: Geometry Essentials

- **Triangles**: Angles sum to 180¬∞.
- **Types**: Equilateral, isosceles, scalene
- **Circles**: Radius, diameter, area = œÄr¬≤
- **Theorems**: Pythagorean (a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤)

Real Example: In a right triangle with legs 3 and 4, the hypotenuse is ‚àö(3¬≤ + 4¬≤) = 5.

Practice: What is the area of a circle with radius 3?
